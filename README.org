* Overview & Logistics

** What is Programming?

+ Programming /is/ the act of writing computer code
+ Programming is /about/ building and working with ideas
+ Programs are composed of /ideas/

** Why JavaScript?

Why not C, C++, Ruby, Perl, Python, Julia, Erlang, Haskell, Clojure, Scheme,
Java, PHP, C#, or Swift?

There are lots of great languages, but:

+ JS is one of the [[http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#tech-lang][the most popular languages in the world]]
+ JS runs everywhere!
  + Browsers, servers, microcontrollers, iOS, Android, and more
+ JS is /expressive/
  + Can represent ideas in natural/interesting ways

** Expectations

+ You will be writing actual *code*
+ High level of abstraction
  + Helper functions provided
+ A complete codebase
  + No libraries!
+ Cannot learn to code in four hours
  + /Can/ experience the /process/ of coding

** Class Format

+ The lecture is meant to be /interactive/
  + Follow along with examples in lecture
  + *Do not hesitate to ask for help with /anything/*
+ Two short lectures and accompanying exercises
+ Two-part project
+ Exercises & Project will be discussed

** Topics Covered

+ *Data*: Primitives & Compound Data
  + Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Arrays, Objects
  + The /what/ of our programs
+ *Functions*: Building Blocks
  + The /how/ of our programs
  + Used to represent /ideas/
+ *Control Flow*: ~if~, ~else if~, ~else~
  + The /logic/ in our programs
  + Allows programs to make /decisions/ based on *data*

* Data

"Data" is what our programs store, manipulate, display and compute. Data is the
/subject/ of our programs.

*Question:* How can we represent characteristics of a *person* as data (/e.g./
Facebook profile)?

** Primitives: Numbers

#+begin_src javascript
1 + 3; // we can use operators to perform addition,
7 * 4 / 3 - 17; // multiplication, divisiion and subtraction
Math.floor(7.682); // There are many mathematical functions
#+end_src

+ Programming is /not/ all about math
  + But math is useful
+ Order of operations matters (PEMDAS)

** Primitives: Strings

#+begin_src javascript
"Hello, World!"; // a string
"Java" + "Script"; // "concatenation" of two strings with the "+" operator
"yay strings".length; // the length of the string can be computed
"make me uppercase".toUpperCase(); // There are many ways to transform text
#+end_src

+ Strings are used to represent text
+ We use double quotes to represent strings
  + Single quotes work too
+ There are [[http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_methods.asp][lots]] of useful operations for working with strings

** Primitives: Booleans

#+begin_src javascript
true; // this is true
false; // this is false
true && false // logical "and"
true || false // logical "or"
!true // logical "not"
1 > 2;
3 <= 1000000;
4 === 4;
"hello".length >= 5;
#+end_src

+ Booleans are how we talk about /logic/
+ *Examples*:
  + /As long as/ some condition is /true/, keep doing something
  + /If/ some condition is /true/, do something. /Otherwise/, do something else.
+ The results of /comparisons/ are booleans

** Interlude: Variables

#+begin_src javascript
var ten = 10; // create variable named `ten` and assign 10 to it.
var myName; // declare a variable without assigning anything
// assign "Josh Lehman" to the existing variable `myName`
myName = "Josh Lehman";
// variable names can be used to reference their values
myName.length > ten;
ten + 5;
ten === 10;
ten = ten + 5; // reassignment
ten === 10;
#+end_src

+ ~var~ is used to *create* a new variable
  + The ~=~ sign is called the /assignment operator/
+ Variables are used:
  + To associate /names/ with /values/
  + As storage locations
+ Variables can be /reassigned/

** Interlude: Equality

#+begin_src javascript
var name = "Josh";
name === "Fred";
name = "Fred";
name === "Fred";
#+end_src

The ~=~ sign is the /assignment/ operator -- it /assigns/ what's on the right to
what's on the right.

We use ~===~ to /test for equality/.

** Compound Data: Objects

#+begin_src javascript
  var josh = {
    name: { first: "Josh", last: "Lehman" }, // nesting is ok!
    age: 26, // key-value pairs are separated with commas
    gender: "male",
    programmer: true
  }
  josh.age; // dot notation
  josh.name.first;
  josh["age"]; // bracket notation
  josh["name"]["first"];
  josh.name.first = "Joshua"; // we can reassign values!
#+end_src

+ Used to talk about entities
+ Comprised of /key,value/ pairs
  + /keys/ are usually represented as strings
  + Combine many kinds of data (hence, *compound*)
+ Access values by /key/:
  + Dot Notation: ~josh.age~, Bracket Notation: ~josh["age"]~

** Compound Data: Arrays

#+begin_src javascript
var luckyNumbers = [12, 19, 7, 3, 28]; // comma separated!
var animals = ["monkey", "giraffe", "cat", "dog", "platypus"];
var people = [
  {name: "Ben Bitdiddle", age: 27},
  {name: "Eva Lu Ator", age: 32},
  {name: "Alyssa P. Hacker", age: 20},
  {name: "Louis Reasoner", age: 54}
];
animals[0]; // "monkey"
people[2]; // {name: "Alyssa P. Hacker", age: 20}
#+end_src

+ Arrays are used to represent /many/ things
  + The elements of arrays can be /anything/: numbers, strings, objects, etc.
+ Usually used to refer to many similar kinds of data
+ Elements are /indexed/ numerically from 0

** All Together Now

#+begin_src javascript
var josh = {
  name: {
    first: "Joshua",
    middle: "Adam",
    last: "Lehman"
  },
  age: 26,
  gender: "male",
  programmer: true,
  favoriteTVShows: ["Fargo", "Breaking Bad", "Battlestar Galactica"],
  pets: [{type: "cat", name: "Cheesus", age: 3, biochipped: true, color: "orange"}]
}
josh.name.middle; // "Adam"
josh.favoriteTVShows[0]; // "Fargo"
josh.pets[0].name; // "Cheesus"
#+end_src

** Recap

+ *Primitives* are the most basic data types
  + Numbers, Strings, Booleans
+ *Variables* are named storage locations
+ *Objects* represent data with multiple characteristics
+ *Arrays* represent many pieces of data (usually similar)

* Functions & Control Flow

/Functions/ allow us to represent a /task/ with a name and parameters.

/Control Flow/ allows us to change the /execution/ of our programs with logic.

** What are Functions?

#+begin_src javascript
// "definition" of function named square that accepts one argument
function square(x) {
  // Inside of the curly braces is called the "body"
  return x * x; // return specifies the "result"
}
// "invocation" of square function
square(5); // "invoking" is also known as "calling"
square(square(5));
#+end_src

+ Functions specify instructions to accomplish some task
+ Usually have a /name/
+ Usually have /arguments/ (the stuff inside the parenthesis)
+ Usually ~return~ a result

** More on Functions

#+begin_src javascript
// Functions frequently have multiple arguments (separated by commas)
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
add(1, 2); // a: 1, b: 2, 1 + 2 => 3

function divide(x, y) {
  return x / y;
}
// The positions of arguments matters, not the names:
divide(9, 3) // x: 9, y: 3, 9 / 3 => 3
divide(3, 9) // x: 3, y: 9, 3 / 9 => 0.333333333
#+end_src

+ Arguments are just named placeholders!
  + The values are supplied when the function is /invoked/ (or "called")

** If & Else Statements

#+begin_src javascript
function canEnterBar(person) {
  // the "condition" is what comes between the parenthesis
  // a condition should evaluate to true or false
  if (person.age >= 21) {
    // executed if condition is true -- this is called the "consequent"
    return "You may enter, " + person.name + ".";
  } else {
    // executed if condition is false -- called the "alternate"
    return "Go home, " + person.name + ".";
  }
}
var louis = {name: "Louis Reasoner", age: 54};
var alyssa = {name: "Alyssa P. Hacker", age: 20};
canEnterBar(louis);
canEnterBar(alyssa);
#+end_src

+ An ~if~ does not need to have an ~else~ following
  + An ~else~ MUST come after an ~if~
+ *NOTE:* The ~return~ keyword causes the function to exit!

** Checking multiple conditions

#+begin_src javascript
function howsTheWeather(temperature) {
  if (temperature >= 90) {
    return "It's way too hot outside."
  } else if (temperature >= 68) {
    return "It's pretty nice outside."
  } else if (temperature >= 32) {
    return "Meh. It's kind of cold."
  } else {
    return "It's way too cold outside."
  }
}
howsTheWeather(72); // "It's pretty nice outside."
howsTheWeather(0); // "It's way too cold outside."
#+end_src

+ Test any number of conditions with ~else if~
+ ~else if~ must follow an ~if~
+ If there's an ~else~, it must be at the end

** Functions are Powerful

#+begin_src javascript
function timesFive(x) { return x * 5; }
function subtractSeven(x) { return x - 7; }

function compose(f, g) {
  return function(x) {
    return f(g(x));
  }
}

var composition = compose(timesFive, subtractSeven);
// f: timesFive, g: subtractSeven, x: 8, timesFive(subtractSeven(8)) => 5
composition(8)
#+end_src

+ Functions can be:
  + Passed as arguments
  + Returned from functions
+ This is what makes JS powerful
** Recap

+ *Functions* describe how to perform a task given arguments (parameters)
  + This keeps us from rewriting the same code over and over
+ *if, else if, else* allow our programs to make /decisions/ based on /data/
