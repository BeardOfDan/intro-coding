#+TITLE: Intro to JS Exercises

* Warmup:

* Project 1: Book Store

** Exercise 0: Building a Table

The Book Store project includes a number of helper functions for constructing a
table of books. Let's explore some of these functions to see how they work.

a) Let's start by exploring the dataset that we'll be working with. In the
=INITIALIZATION= section of the project you'll see ~var bookStore =
generateBookStore()~. ~generateBookStore~ is a function that generates the books
that we'll be working with. Add the following code and then open up a :

#+begin_src javascript
console.log("The books are:", bookStore);
#+end_src

We can use ~console.log~ to see what's happening inside our programs. To see
what was logged, open a console:

a) A table consists of /rows/ and /columns/. In this example, we'll be working
with an array of "books" (the =bookStore= variable), where each book is
represented as an object. Try adding ~console.log(bookStore)~ to the file to see
what this data looks like. Make sure to interact with the logged result to get a
feel for what the data looks like. How many books in the ~bookStore~ are there?
What are the keys of each book? In our table, each book will be a /row/ of the
table, and the /columns/ will be the keys.

b) Most tables have a /header/ that describes

** Exercise 1: Implement a Search Algorithm

#+begin_src javascript
function isMatch(book) {
  return true; // not too helpful
}
#+end_src


a) One way to search our books would be to check if the beginning of the book's
title (=book.title=) was equal to our =query=. JavaScript strings have a method
=substring= that takes two arguments: =begin= and =end=. Try the following at a
console:

#+begin_src javascript
"hello, world".substring(0,3);
"hello, world".substring(3,7);
#+end_src

Given that we can determine the length of our =query= with =query.length=, and
can check equality with ~===~, how can we use =substring= to determine if the
beginning of the book's title matches the =query=?

b) How does your =isMatch= function fare with different cases? Change =isMatch=
to be case-insensitive. Hint: try a search for "javascript lowercase string" in
Google.

c) Modify =isMatch= to search against a different key in the =book= object (e.g.
author). Having to modify the code itself to search against a different field
doesn't seem like a very good solution; ideally we would like to be able to
search by title /or/ author -- fix this by using the logical *or* operator
(~||~) to check against multiple keys at once. Try the following at a console to
get an idea of how ~||~ works:

#+begin_src javascript
true || true
true || false
false || false
var animal = "monkey";
animal === "giraffe" || animal === "monkey"
#+end_src

d) Let's say we're searching for the book "Infinite Jest", and we try searching
for the word "jest" -- does the search work? Why not? Change =isMatch= again so
that it does. The string method =indexOf= can help us here. Try the following to
get an idea of what =indexOf= does:

#+begin_src javascript
"hello, world".indexOf("hello");
"hello, world".indexOf("wor");
"hello, world".indexOf(", w");
"hello, world".indexOf("chimpanzee");
#+end_src
